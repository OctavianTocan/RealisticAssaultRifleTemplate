# RART - Realistic Assault Rifle Template

![SimpleCover](Images/SimpleCover.jpg)

The Realistic Assault Rifle Template is a fully customizable Unreal Engine 5 FPS template featuring a game-ready assault rifle, modular attachments, professional animations, and a robust FPS Blueprint system - providing a strong foundation and giving you full control over animations, weapon behavior, and movement.

It handles the core FPS foundations - realistic movement, shooting mechanics, animations, and weapon setup - so you can focus on designing your own gameplay.

**Note:** The template is made in Unreal Engine 5.0, but it works with any version from 5.0 all the way up to 5.6 (at the time of writing this).
